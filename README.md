<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



Custom Emojiboard is an Android custom keyboard and emoji application developed with Android studio using Java and Flutter (Dart) respectively. This app allows users to upload their own images and GIFs onto the emoji application. The user has the option to edit the image (cropping, tilting, etc.) before finally uploading it on the app.

Once uploaded, the user can view all their uploads on a grid view. The images are uploaded to a Firebase Storage Bucket, which is further referenced in Firebase's backend Realtime Database.

Paired with the Emoji Application is a custom system-wide Android Soft keyboard which has two layouts and functions; 
A standard mobile keyboard with a qwerty layout for regular text typing.

An image-view layout that displays a grid of clickable images and GIFâ€™s that the user has uploaded over on the Emoji app. This is accomplished through Android's SDK which includes the Commit Content API, that provides a universal way for IME's to send images and other rich content directly to a text editor in an app.

On the Image-view on the keyboard up, are all the images and GIF's that the user has uploaded over on the main Emoji app, organized into a grid-view ready to be viewed, clicked-on and shared to friends and family.

Users can go back and forth between both standard keyboard and 'Emojiboard' layouts with a special button on the keyboard.
